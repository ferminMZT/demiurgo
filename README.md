An old C++ genetic programming system from the XX century

This is the original C++ source code for my senior project in Computer Science Engineering,
written in the happy old year of 1998.

Added a makefile for my Linux system.
Added the .gitignore file.
\ToDo: Add optimization flags to the makefile.
